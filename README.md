# SimpleMacScroll
This is a system-wide, HoverScroll-based Mac style Acceleration and Momentum scroll for AutoHotKey. Keep in mind that because Windows operates on Wheel events, and the wheel operates in discrete notches, it will not match up to the trackpad perfectly. For wheels there is no such thing as a "Release" event. What it will do, though, is:

* Work for more than just Chrome windows
* Reverse your scroll direction
* Move slow when you move slow
* Move fast when you move fast
* Have wheel focus follow your cursor
* Have a bit of roll-off when you finish scrolling

Currently under testing with notch-mice and the Air 2011 trackpad.
